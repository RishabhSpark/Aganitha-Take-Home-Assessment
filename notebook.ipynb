      "\n",
      "Players then take turns attempting to knock the target stone off its resting place by throwing the third stone from the opposite side of the angle. The game requires strategy, skill, and precision, as players need to calculate the trajectory and force needed to hit the target without hitting one of the other two stones.\n",

In fact, Ollama was even mentioned in the Codex Mendoza, a pre-Columbian Aztec manuscript.\n",
